# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm Implementation

This project contains Python implementations of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm using both imperative and recursive approaches to find the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph. The project includes a performance comparison between these two approaches as well as unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementations.

## Files and Details

- `recursive_floyd.py`: Recursive approach to solving the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
- `imperative_floyd.py`: Imperative approach, focusing on efficiency and execution speed.
- `unit_test.py`: provides a basic unit tests for verifying the correctness using `unittest` framework.
- `performance_test.py`: Measures and compares the execution time of both implementations, illustrating the trade-offs between recursion and iteration in algorithm design.
- `requirements.txt`: Specifies the Python version required for the project.
